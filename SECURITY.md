# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the **n8n Agentic AI** project, please report it responsibly by following the process outlined below.

Please **DO NOT** open a public issue. Instead, send an email to [girish792004@gmail.com](mailto:girish792004@gmail.com) or use the GitHub security advisories feature. Our team will respond to your report within 48 hours.

## Security Best Practices

- **Avoid exposing sensitive information**: Ensure that sensitive data such as API keys, access tokens, or passwords are **not** included in this repository.
- **Use environment variables**: Always store sensitive credentials and configuration settings in environment variables and **never** in the codebase.
- **Dependencies**: Keep all project dependencies up-to-date to avoid known vulnerabilities. Use tools like [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) to automate this process.

## Vulnerability Disclosure Process

Once a security vulnerability is reported, we will review the issue, assess the severity, and begin working on a fix. A patch or security update will be made available, and affected users will be notified.

We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities as quickly as possible. Affected users will be contacted directly before any public disclosure, if necessary.
